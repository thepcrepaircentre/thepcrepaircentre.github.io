                    <h4>What is an IP camera?</h4>
                    <p>An IP camera (aka Internet Protocol CCTV camera) is a type of type of digital video 
                       camera that is used for surveillance and uses an internet-based network connection 
                       in order to store the data that it records.
                    </p>
                    <p>IP cameras have fast become the best method through which to carry out security 
                       surveillance in both the home and in business. Cheaper, more versatile, and simpler 
                       to install than traditional analogue CCTV systems, the technology has advanced to 
                       such a point that a small system can be set up for as little as a few hundred shillings, 
                       and with a range of utilities and features that would have been unthinkable only a 
                       few years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>They function in much the same way as a typical webcam, however they are far more 
                       versatile and powerful than the camera used in your average Skype conversation! You 
                       can install as many cameras as you need in a single system, and have them both send 
                       and receive data due to their digital nature, meaning you can have a truly 'smart' 
                       security system that's fully catered to your needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>The cameras are typically connected to an NVR (network video recorder) via a network 
                       cable or a wireless connection, which serves as the central hub of the system and 
                       facilitates both the storage of data and an array of other utilities. However, for 
                       smaller systems, the cameras can use on-board flash storage (via an SD memory card), 
                       meaning that you can easily scale the solution to the size of your needs.
