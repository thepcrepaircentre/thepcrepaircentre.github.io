                    <h4>Linux Operating System</h4>
                    <p>
                       Linux is a complete operating system that provides both fully configured, easy to use desktops plus
                       advanced, fine-tuned professional tools, including powerful server solutions.  As a result, Linux provides
                       everything required for both business  and personal needs!  Linux gives you access to thousands of free
                       open-source applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>Linux allows you to select a window manager (Graphical User Interface), offers many web browsers (Mozilla
                       Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, IceDove/Mozilla Thunderbird), picture/photo/graphics manipulation/editing and
                       viewing software as well as it has Office Suite Software (Word Processor, Spreadsheets, Presentation) and 
                       much more!  The Office Suite is compatible with Microsoft Office and has everything you need to create
                       professional documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       It is easy to use, packed with the features you need and completely free.  It can open and view files
                       created in Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Word Perfect and AmiPro.  In addition, because the look and
                       feel of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is similar to that of other desktop productivity suites, most
                       users will be able to learn to use it quickly and easily - with little or no special training required. 
                    </p>
