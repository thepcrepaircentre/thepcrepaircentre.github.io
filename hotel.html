                       <h3>Hotel Internet Access Solution</h3>
                       <p>High quality Internet service is no longer optional for hospitality businesses.
                          It is a guest expectation and a key to customer satisfaction. Yet, providing
                          satisfactory Internet access is not simply a matter of installing Ethernet
                          cables and wireless access points where guests need them. Hospitality
                          businesses need to address the issues of access management, regulation
                          compliance, and providing sufficient bandwidth for an exploding amount of
                          wireless mobile devices.
                       </p>
                       <h3>Benefits</h3>
                       <h4>Increasing customer loyalty</h4>
                       <p>
                       Virtually everyone today has at least one wireless mobile device, like smartphones, 
                       tablets, and laptops computers. Yet, yesterdayâ€™s hotspot gateways can no longer handle 
                       the exploding amount of wireless mobile devices that need Wi-Fi access. To satisfy this 
                       fast-growing demand, hospitality businesses need a solution that can provide greater 
                       Wi-Fi bandwidth, capacity and performance.
                       </p>
                       <h4>Generating revenue</h4>
                       <p>User authentication, and access control features that help hospitality businesses 
                          manage guest accounts, block unauthorized access, and generate
                          revenue with their Internet services. It gives hospitality
                          businesses the flexibility to offer Wi-Fi access as a free
                          service, a tiered service (premium when a purchase is made), or a paid service, 
                          depending on the preferred business model.
